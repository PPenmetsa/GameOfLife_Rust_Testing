Group 05 Testing for Rust


Hello!
Welcome to Rust!
</br>
</br>
The Game of Life code to debug can be found at GameOfLife/src/main.rs </br>
To run this code (building the first time will take a while), please execute the following commands in the repl comman line:
</br>
cd GameOfLife </br>
cargo build </br>
cargo run </br>
</br>
</br>
Before starting your debugging process, you may want to get a small headstart by going thorugh our Learning folder. The file at Learning/src/main.rs contains some basic syntax. You can run this file by executing the following commands: </br>
</br>
cd Learning </br>
cargo build </br>
cargo run </br>
</br>
</br>

After debugging, please return to the email we sent you and fill out the survey. </br>
Happy Debugging!
